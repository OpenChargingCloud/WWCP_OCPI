# Smart Charging Service Providers

Smart Charging Providers (SCSPs) are entities in OCPI which calculate (real-time) charging profiles on behalf
of E-Mobility Service Providers (EMSPs) or Charge Point Operators (CPOs). Therefore they can communicate
directly with EMSP APIs and CPO APIs. When EMSPs are involved, they act as a hub between SCSPs and CPOs,
forwarding charging profiles and commands.


## Communication

Smart Charging Providers communicate with:

- Charge Point Operators (CPOs)
- E-Mobility Service Providers (EMSPs)
