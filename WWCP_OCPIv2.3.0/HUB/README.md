# OCPI Hub

Hubs sit between the CPOs and EMSPs in order to aggregate and to simplify
the communication by avoiding a full mesh of p2p connections between all
participants.

## HubClientInfo

This is a special module of OCPI Hubs allowing CPOs and EMSPs to retrieve
information about all the participants connected to the hub.
