Contributor License Agreement
=============================

Thank you for your interest in the World Wide Charging Protocol Suite (WWCP)
developed by GraphDefined GmbH. The form of license below is a document that
clarifies the terms under which You, the person listed below, may contribute
software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other
materials that you send to us related to the Project (each a "Contribution")
to the project. We appreciate your participation in our project, and your
help in improving the project, so we want you to understand what will be
done with the Contributions. This license is for your protection as well as
the protection of this project and its licensees; it does not change your
rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

If you have questions about these terms, please contact us at
 achim.friedland@graphdefined.com.

 
Corporate Contributions:

If you are employed as a software engineer, or if your employer is in the
business of developing software, or otherwise may claim rights in the
Contributions, please provide information about your employer's policy on
contributing to open source projects, including the name of the supervisor
to contact in connection with such contributions.


You and the GraphDefined GmbH agree:

You grant us the ability to use the Contributions in any open way. You
hereby grant to GraphDefined GmbH, a non-exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide,
royalty-free, sublicenseable, transferable license under all of Your
relevant intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, and any
other rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of, distribute and
publicly perform and display the Contributions on any licensing terms,
including without limitation open source licenses like the GNU General
Public License (GPL), GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL), the Common Public License, the Apache
2.0 license, or the Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD). Except
for the licenses granted herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest
in and to the Contribution.

You are able to grant us these rights. You represent that You are legally
entitled to grant the above license. If Your employer has rights to
intellectual property that You create, You represent that You have received
permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that
Your employer has waived such rights for the Contributions.

The Contributions are your original work. You represent that the
Contributions are Your original works of authorship, and to Your knowledge,
no other person claims, or has the right to claim, any right in any
invention or patent related to the Contributions. You also represent that
You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into an agreement or
otherwise, in any way that conflicts with the terms of this license. For
example, if you have signed an agreement requiring you to assign the
intellectual property rights in the Contributions to an employer or
customer, that would conflict with the terms of this license.

We determine the code that is in our project. You understand that the
decision to include the Contribution in any project or source repository
is entirely that of GraphDefined GmbH, and this agreement does not
guarantee that the Contributions will be included in any product.

No Implied Warranties. GraphDefined GmbH acknowledges that, except as
explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution is provided
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES
OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
